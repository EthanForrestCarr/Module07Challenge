## Description
The README Generator streamlines the process of creating consistent and detailed README files for your projects. Rather than manually writing a new README every time you start a project, this tool helps automate that process, saving time and ensuring uniformity across your repositories. While building this tool, I gained valuable experience in interacting with the file system through terminal commands.
